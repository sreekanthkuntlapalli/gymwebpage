    <p>It can be hard to motivate ourselves to stay healthy, follow a healthy diet and exercise well to keep us fit. So many factors like fast food, a sedentary and busy lifestyle, the expensive nature of nutrient-rich food items, laziness, etc., can all pave the way for us to not care about our health and demotivate us from taking care of it. But we must find time and ways to take care of our health and our parents. Unfortunately, for the elderly, sometimes it becomes a lack of interest in life, leading to a situation wherein they stop prioritising themselves.</p>

    <p>Physical activity forms a core part of any natural health management routine and at Nisarga, we believe in the ‘power of physical exercise’ too. Our health gym, under the supervision of expert doctors ensures that our Sadhakas are correctly guided in their exercise routines, to derive maximum benefit without any adverse effects caused by improper posture or incorrect technique.

     Physical exercise forms part of our unique treatment or rejuvenation packages that we devise for our Sadhakas of different conditions, and we believe that a correctly managed physical conditioning routine assists a great deal in amplifying the effectiveness of other wellness practices. Hence, we have installed a state of the art health gym at our wellness centre, which ensures that our Sadhakas get their much needed physical activity time.

     <p>A swimming pool, swimming bath, wading pool, paddling pool, or simply pool, is a structure designed to hold water to enable swimming or other leisure activities. Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools) or built above ground (as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure), and may be found as a feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools are most commonly constructed from materials such as concrete, natural stone, metal, plastic, or fiberglass, and can be of a custom size and shape or built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the Olympic-size swimming pool.</p>
