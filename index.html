   <h3 class="headings">Nutrition</h3>
   <p>There are mainly three macronutrients that play a crucial role in maintaining bodily functions and even promote changes in strength and composition – they are carbs, proteins, and fats and it is essential that we consume all three macros in ample quantities to optimize progress accordingly. Let’s see what are the vital nutrients you must include in your gym diet plan for muscle gain and weight loss.</p>

   <h3 class="headings">CarboHydrades</h3>
   <img src="./carbohydrates.jpg" alt="carbohydrates">
   <p>Firstly, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body and therefore play the most substantial role in fueling exercise. There are two different types of carbohydrates i.e. complex and simple. The names give an indication of the time taken to digest complex carbs that take a longer time period to digest than simple carbs.
  
   Furthermore, complex carbohydrates provide the body with prolonged slow-release of energy and have a great nutritional benefit. While simple carbohydrates provide the body with a short-term, fast releasing energy, they contain little nutritional value.</p>
   <h3 class="headings">proteins</h3>
   <img src="./protein-1-1.jpg" alt="protein">
   <p>Specifically, the majority of gym-goers will be well aware that consuming protein is important. Likewise, the reason why protein is so important is because it plays a key role in recovery and repair. A gym diet plan must include protein. During exercise, the body is exposed to strains and stresses. This cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. So, in order to repair the damage, protein is needed. Without it, recovery periods will be extended and chronic fatigue may become a factor.
  
       Protein is found most highly in animal produce such as lean meats, eggs & dairy. Similarly, it can also be found in smaller quantities in foods such as seeds, nuts, legumes, beans, and soy</p>
  <h3 class="headings">Fats</h3>
  <img src="./healthy-fats-1.jpg" alt="fats">
  <p>Fats are often incorrectly seen as the primary reason for fat gain. However, fats are not responsible for this and actually play a key role in the absorption and transport of nutrients. In addition, they can have a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.</p>

    <p>It can be hard to motivate ourselves to stay healthy, follow a healthy diet and exercise well to keep us fit. So many factors like fast food, a sedentary and busy lifestyle, the expensive nature of nutrient-rich food items, laziness, etc., can all pave the way for us to not care about our health and demotivate us from taking care of it. But we must find time and ways to take care of our health and our parents. Unfortunately, for the elderly, sometimes it becomes a lack of interest in life, leading to a situation wherein they stop prioritising themselves.</p>
